# Paint Website
A website that allows you to paint in a grid-type canvas.
This is a project from TOP curriculum, it is a simple paint-type website created by using the knowledge acquired from the JS,CSS and HTML modules in the foundation section.
The project still has a lot of room for improvement, specially optimization.
